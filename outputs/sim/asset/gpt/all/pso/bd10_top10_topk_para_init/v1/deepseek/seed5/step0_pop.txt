pso	Paraphrase the above sentences for simplicity while preserving their original meaning.	46.751
pso	Certainly! Here's an optimized version of the prompt based on the best aspects of the three provided:

**New Optimized Prompt:**  
"Simplify and paraphrase the given sentences while preserving their original meaning."	44.0639
pso	Okay, so I need to figure out how to combine the best aspects of these three prompts to create an improved version. Let me start by looking at each one individually.

The first prompt is "simplify and restate the information in the given input." That seems straightforward. It's asking to take whatever information is provided and make it simpler, maybe breaking it down into easier-to-understand terms while restating it.

The second prompt is the same as the first one: "simplify and restate the information in the given input." So, it's reinforcing the idea of simplification and restatement.

The third prompt is a bit different: "Paraphrase the above sentences for simplicity while preserving their original meaning." This one introduces the term "paraphrase," which means to restate something in different words. It also emphasizes simplicity and preserving the original meaning, which is similar to the first two prompts but adds the nuance of using different wording.

So, combining these, I want to make sure the new prompt includes simplification, restatement, and paraphrasing, all while preserving the original meaning. The goal is to make the information more accessible without losing its essence.

I should also consider the structure. The first two prompts are direct, while the third one is a bit more detailed. Maybe the new prompt can be a concise combination of all three, ensuring clarity and effectiveness.

Let me try drafting a few versions:

1. "Simplify, restate, and paraphrase the information in the given input while preserving its original meaning."
2. "Paraphrase and simplify the given information, ensuring the original meaning is maintained."
3. "Restate the input in simpler terms, using different wording to preserve its original meaning."

Hmm, the first version includes all three aspects: simplify, restate, and paraphrase. It also mentions preserving the original meaning. That seems comprehensive.

The second version combines paraphrase and simplify, which covers two aspects, but it might be missing the explicit restatement part. Although, paraphrasing inherently involves restating, so maybe it's covered.

The third version focuses on restating and using different wording, which covers paraphrasing and simplification. It also mentions preserving the original meaning.

I think the first version is the most comprehensive because it explicitly includes all three actions: simplify, restate, and paraphrase. It also clearly states the goal of preserving the original meaning.

So, the optimized prompt would be: "Simplify, restate, and paraphrase the information in the given input while preserving its original meaning."

Wait, but is that too wordy? Maybe I can make it a bit more concise without losing the meaning. Let me try:

"Simplify, restate, and paraphrase the input, preserving its original meaning."

That's shorter and still includes all the key elements. It tells the user to simplify, restate, and paraphrase, and to make sure the original meaning is kept.

Alternatively, "Paraphrase and simplify the input, ensuring the original meaning is maintained." This version is also concise but might not explicitly mention restating, though paraphrasing does involve restating.

I think the first revised version is better because it explicitly includes all three actions, making it clear what is expected.

So, the final optimized prompt would be: "Simplify, restate, and paraphrase the input, preserving its original meaning."
The optimized prompt combines the best aspects of the three original prompts by explicitly including simplification, restatement, and paraphrasing, while ensuring the original meaning is preserved. Here is the final version:
