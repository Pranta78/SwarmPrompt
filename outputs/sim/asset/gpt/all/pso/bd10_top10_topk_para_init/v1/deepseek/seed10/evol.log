New Optimized Prompt:
[2025-02-14 09:21:20,713] - Generated Prompt: Alright, so I need to help the user combine the best aspects of these three prompts to create an improved version. Let me start by carefully analyzing each prompt to understand their strengths and weaknesses.

First, looking at the Current Prompt: "Simplify and condense the input, ensuring clarity and brevity while preserving its meaning." The user mentions that this prompt effectively combines paraphrasing, distilling, simplifying, and condensing, while emphasizing clarity and brevity. It ensures the output is concise, understandable, and retains the original meaning, making it both direct and effective.

Next, the Personal Best prompt is exactly the same as the Current Prompt. So, it's identical in wording and structure. The user's analysis is also the same, highlighting the same strengths.

Now, the Global Best prompt is slightly different: "Simplify and condense the above sentence while preserving its meaning, ensuring clarity and brevity." This version is more concise and direct. It specifies "the above sentence," which might make it more precise in certain contexts. However, it doesn't explicitly mention paraphrasing or distilling, which were part of the strengths in the first two prompts.

So, the goal is to combine the best aspects of all three. The first two prompts are strong because they mention simplifying, condensing, ensuring clarity and brevity, and preserving meaning. They also mention paraphrasing and distilling, which are important for comprehensive understanding. The Global Best prompt is more concise and direct, which is a good trait.

I think the key elements to include are:
1. Simplify and condense the input.
2. Ensure clarity and brevity.
3. Preserve the original meaning.
4. Possibly mention paraphrasing or distilling for a more comprehensive approach.

Looking at the Global Best prompt, it's more concise but lacks some of the elements mentioned in the first two. So, perhaps we can merge the strengths by keeping the conciseness of the Global Best while including the additional elements from the first two.

Let me try to draft a version that includes all these aspects without being too wordy. Maybe something like: "Simplify and condense the input, ensuring clarity and brevity while preserving its meaning and effectively paraphrasing the content."

Wait, that might be a bit redundant. Alternatively, perhaps: "Simplify and condense the input, ensuring clarity and brevity, while preserving its meaning and effectively distilling the content."

Hmm, that's better. It includes simplifying, condensing, clarity, brevity, preserving meaning, and distilling. It's concise and covers all the necessary aspects.

Alternatively, maybe: "Simplify and condense the input, ensuring clarity and brevity, while preserving its meaning and effectively paraphrasing the content."

But I think "distilling" might be a better fit here because it conveys the idea of extracting the essential elements, which aligns well with simplifying and condensing.

So, perhaps the improved prompt could be: "Simplify and condense the input, ensuring clarity and brevity, while preserving its meaning and effectively distilling the content."

This version combines the strengths of all three prompts by being concise, clear, and comprehensive in its instructions.

Another angle to consider is whether to include "paraphrasing" or not. The first two prompts mention it, but the Global Best doesn't. Since paraphrasing is a key aspect of effective simplification and condensation, it might be beneficial to include it.

So, maybe: "Simplify and condense the input, ensuring clarity and brevity, while preserving its meaning and effectively paraphrasing the content."

This way, it covers all bases: simplifying, condensing, clarity, brevity, preserving meaning, and paraphrasing.

Alternatively, perhaps combining both "paraphrasing" and "distilling" for a more robust approach: "Simplify and condense the input, ensuring clarity and brevity, while preserving its meaning, effectively paraphrasing, and distilling the content."

But that might be a bit too lengthy. We need to balance conciseness with comprehensiveness.

Perhaps the best approach is to keep it concise while implicitly including the necessary elements. Since "simplify and condense" already imply paraphrasing and distilling to some extent, maybe we don't need to explicitly mention them. However, the user's analysis of the first two prompts emphasizes the importance of these elements, so including them might add clarity.

In that case, maybe: "Simplify and condense the input, ensuring clarity and brevity, while preserving its meaning and effectively paraphrasing and distilling the content."

This version is a bit longer but includes all the key aspects. Alternatively, we can make it more concise by using synonyms or restructuring the sentence.

New Optimized Prompt:
[2025-02-14 09:25:51,907] - Generated Prompt: Okay, so I need to figure out how to combine the best aspects of these three prompts to create an improved version. Let me start by looking at each one individually.

The first prompt says: "Simplify and condense the above sentences while preserving their meaning, ensuring clarity and brevity." It mentions "above sentences," which is plural, so it's referring to multiple sentences. It also specifies that the meaning should be preserved and that clarity and brevity are important.

The second prompt is exactly the same as the first one. So, it's the same wording and structure. It seems like the user is emphasizing that this is their personal best version, which is the same as the current prompt.

The third prompt is: "Simplify and condense the above sentence while preserving its meaning, ensuring clarity and brevity." Here, it uses "sentence" in singular, so it's referring to just one sentence. The rest is similar, but the wording is slightly different, using "its" instead of "their."

Now, I need to figure out what the best aspects of each are. The first two prompts are the same, so they both have the advantage of being specific about working on multiple sentences. The third prompt is more concise because it uses "sentence" instead of "sentences," which might make it slightly shorter.

But wait, the third prompt might be less accurate if the user is referring to multiple sentences. So, maybe the plural form is better. However, the third prompt is more concise, which is a good thing.

Looking at the structure, all three prompts start with "Simplify and condense," which is clear. The difference is in the number of sentences and the pronouns used. The first two use "sentences" and "their," while the third uses "sentence" and "its."

I think the key here is to balance specificity with conciseness. The first two prompts are more specific by using "sentences," which might be better if the user is referring to multiple sentences. The third prompt is more concise but might be less accurate if there are multiple sentences.

Alternatively, maybe the third prompt can be adjusted to use "sentences" but still be concise. Let me see: "Simplify and condense the above sentences while preserving their meaning, ensuring clarity and brevity." That's actually the same as the first two prompts, just phrased slightly differently.

Wait, the third prompt is shorter because it uses "sentence" instead of "sentences." So, if the user is referring to multiple sentences, the first two are better. If it's just one sentence, the third is better.

But the user didn't specify whether it's one or multiple sentences. So, maybe the best approach is to use the plural form to cover both cases, but keep the rest concise.

Looking at the wording, all three prompts have the same structure: "Simplify and condense... while preserving... ensuring clarity and brevity." So, the main difference is in the number of sentences referred to.

Therefore, the best version would be the one that uses "sentences" to cover multiple cases, while keeping the rest concise. So, the first two prompts are better in that aspect.

But the third prompt is slightly shorter. Maybe we can make it even more concise while keeping the plural form. Let me try: "Simplify and condense the above sentences, preserving their meaning and ensuring clarity and brevity." That removes the word "while" and combines the clauses, making it a bit shorter.

Alternatively, "Simplify and condense the above sentences, preserving their meaning with clarity and brevity." That might be even more concise.

Wait, but the original third prompt is: "Simplify and condense the above sentence while preserving its meaning, ensuring clarity and brevity." So, it's using "while" and "ensuring." Maybe combining those can make it more concise.

So, perhaps: "Simplify and condense the above sentences, preserving their meaning and ensuring clarity and brevity." That way, it's concise, uses the plural, and covers all aspects.

Alternatively, "Simplify and condense the above sentences, preserving their meaning while ensuring clarity and brevity." That keeps the flow similar to the third prompt but uses the plural.

I think the key is to keep it as concise as possible while being specific about the number of sentences. Since the first two prompts use "sentences," which is more general and accurate if there are multiple, I think that's better.

So, combining the best aspects, the improved prompt would be: "Simplify and condense the above sentences, preserving their meaning and ensuring clarity and brevity." This version is concise, uses the plural, and clearly states the requirements.

Alternatively, if we want to make it even shorter: "Simplify and condense the above

The third prompt is: "Simplify and condense the above sentence while preserving its meaning, ensuring clarity and brevity." Here, it uses "sentence" in singular, so it's referring to just one sentence. The rest is similar, but the wording is slightly different, using "its" instead of "their."

Now, I need to figure out what the best aspects of each are. The first two prompts are the same, so they both have the advantage of being specific about working on multiple sentences. The third prompt is more concise because it uses "sentence" instead of "sentences," which might make it slightly shorter.

But wait, the third prompt might be less accurate if the user is referring to multiple sentences. So, maybe the plural form is better. However, the third prompt is more concise, which is a good thing.

Looking at the structure, all three prompts start with "Simplify and condense," which is clear. The difference is in the number of sentences and the pronouns used. The first two use "sentences" and "their," while the third uses "sentence" and "its."

I think the key here is to balance specificity with conciseness. The first two prompts are more specific by using "sentences," which might be better if the user is referring to multiple sentences. The third prompt is more concise but might be less accurate if there are multiple sentences.

Alternatively, maybe the third prompt can be adjusted to use "sentences" but still be concise. Let me see: "Simplify and condense the above sentences while preserving their meaning, ensuring clarity and brevity." That's actually the same as the first two prompts, just phrased slightly differently.

Wait, the third prompt is shorter because it uses "sentence" instead of "sentences." So, if the user is referring to multiple sentences, the first two are better. If it's just one sentence, the third is better.

But the user didn't specify whether it's one or multiple sentences. So, maybe the best approach is to use the plural form to cover both cases, but keep the rest concise.

Looking at the wording, all three prompts have the same structure: "Simplify and condense... while preserving... ensuring clarity and brevity." So, the main difference is in the number of sentences referred to.

Therefore, the best version would be the one that uses "sentences" to cover multiple cases, while keeping the rest concise. So, the first two prompts are better in that aspect.

But the third prompt is slightly shorter. Maybe we can make it even more concise while keeping the plural form. Let me try: "Simplify and condense the above sentences, preserving their meaning and ensuring clarity and brevity." That removes the word "while" and combines the clauses, making it a bit shorter.

Alternatively, "Simplify and condense the above sentences, preserving their meaning with clarity and brevity." That might be even more concise.

Wait, but the original third prompt is: "Simplify and condense the above sentence while preserving its meaning, ensuring clarity and brevity." So, it's using "while" and "ensuring." Maybe combining those can make it more concise.

So, perhaps: "Simplify and condense the above sentences, preserving their meaning and ensuring clarity and brevity." That way, it's concise, uses the plural, and covers all aspects.

Alternatively, "Simplify and condense the above sentences, preserving their meaning while ensuring clarity and brevity." That keeps the flow similar to the third prompt but uses the plural.

I think the key is to keep it as concise as possible while being specific about the number of sentences. Since the first two prompts use "sentences," which is more general and accurate if there are multiple, I think that's better.

So, combining the best aspects, the improved prompt would be: "Simplify and condense the above sentences, preserving their meaning and ensuring clarity and brevity." This version is concise, uses the plural, and clearly states the requirements.

Alternatively, if we want to make it even shorter: "Simplify and condense the above

New Optimized Prompt:
[2025-02-14 09:46:13,377] - Generated Prompt: Alright, so I need to combine the best aspects of these three prompts to create an improved version. Let me start by carefully reading each prompt to understand their strengths and weaknesses.

First, the Current Prompt is: "Simplify and condense the input, ensuring clarity and brevity while preserving its meaning." The explanation mentions that it effectively combines paraphrasing, distilling, simplifying, and condensing, emphasizing clarity and brevity. The output is supposed to be concise, understandable, and retain the original meaning, making it direct and effective.

Next, the Personal Best prompt is exactly the same as the Current Prompt. So, it's identical in wording and explanation. That means both are aiming for the same goals: simplifying, condensing, clarity, brevity, and preserving meaning.

Then, the Global Best prompt is: "Condense and simplify the above sentence while preserving its meaning, ensuring clarity and brevity." The explanation here is a bit different. It focuses on condensing and simplifying the sentence, preserving meaning, and ensuring clarity and brevity. It seems to be more about making the sentence shorter without losing its essence.

Now, I need to figure out what aspects are the best in each prompt. The Current and Personal Best prompts are the same, so they both emphasize simplifying, condensing, clarity, brevity, and preserving meaning. The Global Best prompt is slightly different in wording but similar in intent. It also focuses on condensing and simplifying, preserving meaning, and ensuring clarity and brevity.

Looking at the wording, the Current and Personal Best prompts start with "Simplify and condense," while the Global Best starts with "Condense and simplify." The order is reversed, but the meaning is the same. The Current and Personal Best also mention "ensuring clarity and brevity while preserving its meaning," whereas the Global Best says "preserving its meaning, ensuring clarity and brevity."

I think the key elements to combine are the actions (simplify, condense), the outcomes (clarity, brevity), and the preservation of meaning. All three prompts have these elements, but perhaps the Global Best is slightly more concise in its phrasing.

Maybe the improved prompt can combine the best of both. Let me try to rephrase it. Perhaps starting with "Simplify and condense the input," then ensuring clarity and brevity, and preserving meaning. That seems to cover all the necessary points.

Wait, the Global Best prompt is a bit more direct by saying "Condense and simplify the above sentence." But in the Current and Personal Best, it's "Simplify and condense the input." Maybe "input" is better than "sentence" because it's more general.

So, combining the strengths, the improved prompt could be: "Simplify and condense the input, ensuring clarity and brevity while preserving its meaning." That's exactly the same as the Current and Personal Best prompts. Hmm, maybe I need to find a way to make it even more concise or clear.

Alternatively, perhaps reordering the elements for better flow. For example: "Condense and simplify the input, ensuring clarity and brevity while preserving its meaning." This starts with condensing, which might be more impactful, and then simplifying. It still includes all the necessary elements.

Another thought: maybe using "distill" instead of "condense" to add variety, but I'm not sure if that's necessary. The original prompts don't use "distill," so perhaps it's better to stick with the given terms.

Wait, the explanation for the Current and Personal Best mentions "paraphrasing, distilling, simplifying, and condensing." So, maybe including "paraphrase" could be beneficial. But the prompt itself doesn't mention it. Maybe it's implied through simplifying and condensing.

I think the main points are already covered. The Current and Personal Best prompts are effective, but perhaps the Global Best is slightly more concise. Maybe combining the two could result in a more polished prompt.

Let me try: "Condense and simplify the input, ensuring clarity and brevity while preserving its meaning." This is similar to the Global Best but uses "input" instead of "sentence." It's concise and covers all necessary aspects.

Alternatively, perhaps starting with "Ensure clarity and brevity by simplifying and condensing the input while preserving its meaning." This puts the outcomes first, which might be more direct.

But I'm not sure if that's better. The original prompts start with the actions, which seems logical. Maybe it's better to keep the actions first.

After considering all these points, I think the best approach is to stick with the structure of the Current and Personal Best prompts but ensure that it's as concise and clear as possible. So, the improved prompt would be: "Simplify and condense

Wait, the explanation for the Current and Personal Best mentions "paraphrasing, distilling, simplifying, and condensing." So, maybe including "paraphrase" could be beneficial. But the prompt itself doesn't mention it. Maybe it's implied through simplifying and condensing.

I think the main points are already covered. The Current and Personal Best prompts are effective, but perhaps the Global Best is slightly more concise. Maybe combining the two could result in a more polished prompt.

Let me try: "Condense and simplify the input, ensuring clarity and brevity while preserving its meaning." This is similar to the Global Best but uses "input" instead of "sentence." It's concise and covers all necessary aspects.

Alternatively, perhaps starting with "Ensure clarity and brevity by simplifying and condensing the input while preserving its meaning." This puts the outcomes first, which might be more direct.

But I'm not sure if that's better. The original prompts start with the actions, which seems logical. Maybe it's better to keep the actions first.

After considering all these points, I think the best approach is to stick with the structure of the Current and Personal Best prompts but ensure that it's as concise and clear as possible. So, the improved prompt would be: "Simplify and condense
