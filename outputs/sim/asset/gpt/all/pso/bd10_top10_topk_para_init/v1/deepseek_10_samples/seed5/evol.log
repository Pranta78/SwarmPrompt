[2025-02-14 15:48:13,362] - Generated Prompt: Okay, so I need to combine the best aspects of these three prompts to create an improved version. Let me look at each one carefully.

The first prompt is: "Simplify, restate, and rephrase the information in the given input while ensuring the original meaning is preserved." It mentions simplification, restatement, rephrasing, and preserving meaning. That's pretty good.

The second prompt is the same as the first one, so nothing new there.

The third prompt is: "Clarify, simplify, restate, and rephrase the information in the given input, ensuring the original meaning is preserved." This one adds "clarify" to the list of actions, which might be helpful. It also keeps the same structure but adds that extra step.

So, combining the best parts, I should include all the actions from the third prompt because it has an extra one, "clarify," which can make the prompt more comprehensive. Also, the structure is clear and concise.

I think the improved prompt should include "clarify," "simplify," "restate," and "rephrase," all while ensuring the original meaning is preserved. That way, it covers all bases and is as effective as possible.

Let me put that together: "Clarify, simplify, restate, and rephrase the information in the given input, ensuring the original meaning is preserved." Yeah, that sounds good. It includes all the necessary actions and emphasizes preserving the meaning, making it both comprehensive and concise.
**Clarify, simplify, restate, and rephrase the information in the given input, ensuring the original meaning is preserved.**

This prompt effectively combines all key elements, including clarification, simplification, restatement, and rephrasing, while emphasizing the preservation of the original meaning. It is both comprehensive and concise.
