**Prompt 1:** Revise the given text by clarifying the content with more straightforward language, making complicated statements easier to understand, while retaining the essential meaning and promoting clarity by cutting out extraneous words.  
**Prompt 2:** Alter the supplied text to facilitate clarity without changing its message, ensuring that it is simplified and easy to understand while maintaining the essential meaning.

**Different parts:**
- "Revise the given text by clarifying the content" vs. "Alter the supplied text to facilitate clarity"
- "making complicated statements easier to understand" vs. "ensuring that it is simplified and easy to understand"
- "retaining the essential meaning" vs. "maintaining the essential meaning"
- "promoting clarity by cutting out extraneous words" vs. No direct equivalent in Prompt 2

### 2. Randomly mutate the different parts:
- "Revise the given text by clarifying the content" → "Transform the provided text for better clarity"
- "Alter the supplied text to facilitate clarity" → "Modify the text to enhance clarity"
- "making complicated statements easier to understand" → "simplifying difficult statements"
- "ensuring that it is simplified and easy to understand" → "making it clearer and more digestible"
- "retaining the essential meaning" → "preserving the core message"
- "promoting clarity by cutting out extraneous words" → "improving clarity by removing unnecessary words"

### 3. Combine the different parts with Prompt 3, selectively replace it with the different parts in step 2 and generate a new prompt:
**Prompt 3:** Rewrite the supplied text to simplify complex statements while preserving the core meaning, ensuring clarity and eliminating unnecessary words or phrases.

**New Prompt:** Transform the provided text for better clarity by simplifying difficult statements while preserving the core message, making it clearer and more digestible.

### 4. Crossover the prompt in step 3 with the following basic prompt and generate a final prompt bracketed with <prompt> and </prompt>:
**Basic Prompt:** Alter the provided text to enhance clarity using simpler language, ensuring that the core meaning is maintained and unnecessary terms are removed.

**Final Prompt:** <prompt>Modify the text to enhance clarity by transforming it for better understanding, simplifying difficult statements, and preserving the core message while removing unnecessary words.</prompt>

### Step 1: Identify the different parts between Prompt 1 and Prompt 2
**Prompt 1:** Transform the given text into clearer language by streamlining intricate statements, rephrasing them while condensing the details and removing redundant expressions, ensuring that the core message remains intact.

**Prompt 2:** Reword the supplied content to make it simpler while ensuring the core message remains clear and intact.

**Different Parts:**
- "Transform the given text into clearer language" vs "Reword the supplied content"
- "by streamlining intricate statements, rephrasing them while condensing the details and removing redundant expressions" vs "to make it simpler"
- "ensuring that the core message remains intact" is similar in both.

### Step 2: Randomly mutate the different parts
- "Transform the given text into clearer language" -> "Rephrase the provided material for better clarity"
- "Reword the supplied content" -> "Adjust the content you have received"
- "by streamlining intricate statements, rephrasing them while condensing the details and removing redundant expressions" -> "by simplifying complex ideas and eliminating unnecessary details"
- "to make it simpler" -> "to enhance its simplicity"

### Step 3: Combine the different parts with Prompt 3, selectively replace it with the different parts in step 2 and generate a new prompt
**Prompt 3:** Simplify complex phrases by rewriting the input text into a more straightforward version, omitting unnecessary words while maintaining the core message.

**New Prompt:** Rephrase the provided material for better clarity by simplifying complex ideas and eliminating unnecessary details, while ensuring that the core message remains intact.

### Step 4: Crossover the prompt in step 3 with the following basic prompt and generate a final prompt bracketed with <prompt> and </prompt>
**Basic Prompt:** Simplify complex phrases by rewriting the input text into a more straightforward version, omitting unnecessary words while maintaining the core message.

**Final Prompt:** <prompt>Rephrase the provided material for better clarity by simplifying complex ideas and eliminating unnecessary details, while maintaining the core message as you rewrite it into a more straightforward version.</prompt>

- "eliminating unnecessary words" vs "preserving its essence and simplifying complicated statements"
- "ensuring the core message remains clear and intact" vs "without altering its core message."

### Step 2: Randomly mutate the different parts
- "Simplify the provided material" → "Condense the supplied content"
- "Transform the given text" → "Revise the provided text"
- "by rephrasing it into an easier version" → "by restating it in simpler terms"
- "by rewriting the provided material to clarify the message" → "by modifying the text for better clarity"
- "eliminating unnecessary words" → "removing extraneous phrases"
- "preserving its essence and simplifying complicated statements" → "maintaining its core idea while clarifying complex sections"
- "ensuring the core message remains clear and intact" → "ensuring the main idea is clear and preserved"
- "without altering its core message" → "while keeping the fundamental message unchanged"

### Step 3: Combine the different parts with Prompt 3
**Prompt 3:** "Simplify complex statements by clarifying and reformulating the provided text, eliminating unnecessary terms while retaining the intended meaning and conveying it clearly. Rewrite the provided sentences in a simpler form."

**New Prompt:** "Revise the provided text by modifying it for better clarity and restating it in simpler terms, removing extraneous phrases while ensuring the main idea is clear and preserved."

### Step 4: Crossover the prompt in Step 3 with the Basic Prompt
**Basic Prompt:** "Transform the provided text by clarifying intricate phrases without altering its message, and simplify it into more accessible language while removing superfluous terms or expressions."

**Final Prompt:** <prompt> "Condense the supplied content by transforming the provided text, clarifying intricate phrases, and restating it in simpler terms, while maintaining its core idea and removing superfluous expressions." </prompt>

- "to make it simpler" vs. "into an easier version"
- "eliminating unnecessary words" vs. "cutting out unnecessary words"
- "while ensuring the core message remains clear and intact" (this part is similar in both prompts)

### Step 2: Randomly mutate the different parts
- "Reword the supplied content" → "Transform the given text"
- "Simplify the provided material by rephrasing it" → "Clarify the submitted information by rewording it"
- "to make it simpler" → "for easier understanding"
- "into an easier version" → "to a more accessible format"
- "eliminating unnecessary words" → "removing superfluous phrases"
- "cutting out unnecessary words" → "trimming excessive language"

### Step 3: Combine the different parts with Prompt 3
**Prompt 3**: "Condense the given content into a more straightforward format by rewording the supplied material to make it simpler while cutting redundant phrases while ensuring the core message remains clear and intact."

**New Prompt**: "Transform the given text into a more accessible format by clarifying the submitted information for easier understanding while trimming excessive language and ensuring the core message remains clear and intact."

- "rewriting it to clarify the message" -> "redrafting it to enhance clarity"
- "eliminating superfluous language" -> "removing unnecessary verbiage"
- "eliminating excess wording" -> "cutting extraneous language"
- "maintaining the core meaning consistently" -> "retaining the primary concept effectively"
- "preserving its essence and eliminating excess wording without changing its fundamental idea" -> "keeping the essential idea intact while trimming unnecessary words"

### Step 3: Combine the different parts with Prompt 3

**Prompt 3:** Edit the supplied text by clarifying complicated expressions into a simpler format, simplifying complex phrases, and discarding unnecessary words while keeping the fundamental idea clear.

**New Prompt:** Alter the supplied material by refining unclear sentences for better understanding, converting complex phrases into straightforward terms, and cutting extraneous language while retaining the primary concept effectively.

### Step 4: Crossover the prompt in step 3 with the following basic prompt and generate a final prompt
