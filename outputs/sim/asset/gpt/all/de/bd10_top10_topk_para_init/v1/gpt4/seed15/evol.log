2. "enhance comprehension" vs "reducing the complexity"
3. "modifying the text to simplify the provided phrases" vs "for better clarity while retaining their original intent"
4. "keeping the essence intact and improving readability" vs "utilizing simpler language"

### Step 2: Randomly mutate the different parts

- "transform the given phrases" → "revamp the provided statements"
- "revise the supplied text" → "edit the given content"
- "enhance comprehension" → "improve understanding"
- "reducing the complexity" → "simplifying the structure"
- "modifying the text to simplify the provided phrases" → "to clarify the supplied expressions"
- "for better clarity while retaining their original intent" → "for increased lucidity while maintaining the initial meaning"
- "keeping the essence intact and improving readability" → "preserving the core message and boosting readability"
- "utilizing simpler language" → "employing more straightforward wording"

### Step 3: Combine the different parts with Prompt 3, selectively replace it with the different parts in step 2 and generate a new prompt

**Prompt 3:** Rephrase the given text for better understanding by simplifying the content to enhance its clarity while ensuring the core meaning is retained.

**New Prompt:** Revamp the provided statements for better understanding by simplifying the structure to clarify the supplied expressions while ensuring the core message is preserved.

### Step 4: Crossover the prompt in step 3 with the following basic prompt and generate a final prompt bracketed with <prompt> and </prompt>

**Basic Prompt:** Make the provided sentences easier to understand.

**Final Prompt:** <prompt>Revamp the provided statements to make them easier to understand by simplifying the structure and clarifying the supplied expressions while preserving the core message.</prompt>
