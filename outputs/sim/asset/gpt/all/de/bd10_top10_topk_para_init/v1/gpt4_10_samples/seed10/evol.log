[2025-02-14 16:46:01,644] - de original prompt: Sure! Let's go through the steps to generate a better prompt.

### Step 1: Identify the Different Parts between the Prompt 1 and Prompt 2
- **Prompt 1:** Revise the given text for better clarity while ensuring the original meaning is maintained, making the above sentence easier to understand and preserving its core idea.
- **Prompt 2:** Transform the supplied sentence to make it easier to understand by rewording it while keeping the initial meaning intact, and reformulate the original text in a more understandable and concise manner, preserving its core meaning by clarifying complicated phrases and removing superfluous elements.

**Different parts:**
- "Revise the given text for better clarity" vs. "Transform the supplied sentence to make it easier to understand"
- "ensuring the original meaning is maintained" vs. "keeping the initial meaning intact"
- "making the above sentence easier to understand" vs. "reformulate the original text in a more understandable and concise manner"
- "preserving its core idea" vs. "preserving its core meaning by clarifying complicated phrases and removing superfluous elements"

### Step 2: Randomly Mutate the Different Parts
- "Revise the given text for better clarity" -> "Enhance the provided content for improved clarity"
- "Transform the supplied sentence to make it easier to understand" -> "Rephrase the given statement to simplify comprehension"
- "ensuring the original meaning is maintained" -> "while retaining the original intent"
- "keeping the initial meaning intact" -> "preserving the initial significance"
- "making the above sentence easier to understand" -> "rendering the prior statement more comprehensible"
- "reformulate the original text in a more understandable and concise manner" -> "redesign the text to be clearer and more succinct"
- "preserving its core idea" -> "upholding its essential message"
- "clarifying complicated phrases and removing superfluous elements" -> "simplifying complex expressions and eliminating unnecessary details"

### Step 3: Combine the Different Parts with Prompt 3
**Prompt 3:** Convert the provided statement into a clearer form while retaining its essence by simplifying complex sentences and eliminating unnecessary words or phrases.

**New Prompt:** Rephrase the given statement to simplify comprehension while retaining the original intent by enhancing the provided content for improved clarity and simplifying complex expressions.

### Step 4: Crossover the Prompt in Step 3 with the Basic Prompt
**Basic Prompt:** Summarize the given material by simplifying the provided text, clarifying complex phrases, and cutting unnecessary words, while preserving the original meaning and presenting the information more clearly and succinctly.

**Final Prompt:** <prompt>Rephrase the given statement to simplify comprehension while retaining the original intent by summarizing the provided text, clarifying complex phrases, and eliminating unnecessary details to present the information more clearly and succinctly.</prompt>

This final prompt maintains the task of simplifying a statement while incorporating elements from the basic prompt and the newly mutated components.
