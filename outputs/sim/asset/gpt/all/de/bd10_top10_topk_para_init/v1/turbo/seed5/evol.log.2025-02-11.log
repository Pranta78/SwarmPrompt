1. Identify the different parts between the Prompt 1 and Prompt 2:
Prompt 1: Your task is to classify the comment as one of the following categories: terrible, bad, okay, good, great.
Prompt 2: In this task, you are given sentences from movie reviews. The task is to classify a sentence as one of the following categories: terrible, bad, okay, good, great.
2. Randomly mutate the different parts
3. Combine the different parts with Prompt 3, selectively replace it with the different parts in step 2 and generate a new prompt.
Prompt 3: Assess a movie or a book based on its explanation and determine the sentiment of the movie review. Have your colleague's evaluation of the movie they watched be expressed in a concise remark (e.g. awesome, all right, terrible, or horrendous) following the narrative synopsis they were provided, and choose from terrible, bad, okay, good and great to describe the movie.
4. Crossover the prompt in the step3 with the following basic prompt and generate a final prompt bracketed with <prompt> and </prompt>:
Basic Prompt: You are a sentiment classifier. To do this, you must first understand the meaning of the sentence and any relevant context. And then you should classify it as one of the following categories: terrible, bad, okay, good, great.

1. Identifying the different parts between Prompt 1 and Prompt 2:

New Prompt: In this assignment, you will receive movie review sentences. Your job is to evaluate the review and determine the sentiment, choosing from terrible, bad, okay, good, and great to describe the movie.

4. Crossover the prompt in step 3 with the following basic prompt and generate a final prompt bracketed with <prompt> and </prompt>:
Basic Prompt: You are a sentiment classifier. To do this, you must first understand the meaning of the sentence and any relevant context. And then you should classify it as one of the following categories: terrible, bad, okay, good, great.
