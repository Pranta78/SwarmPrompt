### Step 1: Identify the different parts between the Prompt 1 and Prompt 2

**Prompt 1:** Revise the previous assertion by restating and condensing the main points from the text for clarity. Simplify the language while ensuring accessibility and remove redundant terms without changing the original meaning.

**Prompt 2:** Restate the previous message in a more straightforward manner, ensuring clarity and maintaining its original meaning by condensing unnecessary details.

**Different parts:**
- "Revise the previous assertion" vs "Restate the previous message"
- "by restating and condensing the main points from the text for clarity" vs "in a more straightforward manner, ensuring clarity"
- "Simplify the language while ensuring accessibility" vs "maintaining its original meaning"
- "remove redundant terms without changing the original meaning" vs "by condensing unnecessary details."

### Step 2: Randomly mutate the different parts

- "Revise the previous assertion" -> "Reformulate the earlier statement"
- "Restate the previous message" -> "Reword the preceding communication"
- "by restating and condensing the main points from the text for clarity" -> "to clarify and condense the key ideas"
- "in a more straightforward manner, ensuring clarity" -> "in a simpler way, focusing on clarity"
- "Simplify the language while ensuring accessibility" -> "Make the language more user-friendly"
- "maintaining its original meaning" -> "keeping its intended message"
- "remove redundant terms without changing the original meaning" -> "eliminate unnecessary phrases while preserving meaning"
- "by condensing unnecessary details." -> "by trimming extraneous information."

### Step 3: Combine the different parts with Prompt 3

**Prompt 3:** "Rephrase and condense the provided text, ensuring clarity and accessibility without altering the original meaning by removing unnecessary words or phrases."

**New Prompt:** "Reformulate the earlier statement by rephrasing and condensing the key ideas to clarify while making the language more user-friendly. Ensure that you keep its intended message and eliminate unnecessary phrases without changing the original meaning."

### Step 4: Crossover the prompt in Step 3 with the Basic Prompt

**Basic Prompt:** Revise and shorten the supplied material by restating the provided statements for better understanding. Clarify and rephrase the details while simplifying complex expressions and cutting excess language without altering the original meaning.

**Final Prompt:** 
<prompt>Reformulate the earlier statement by revising and shortening the supplied material to clarify and condense the key ideas. Make the language more user-friendly while ensuring you keep its intended message and eliminate unnecessary phrases without altering the original meaning.</prompt> 

This final prompt combines elements of clarity, conciseness, and accessibility while ensuring the intended meaning remains intact.
