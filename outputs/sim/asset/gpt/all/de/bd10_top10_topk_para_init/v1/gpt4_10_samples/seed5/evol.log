"Your task is to" -> "Your mission is to"
"In this task, you are given sentences from movie reviews. The task is to" -> "In this assignment, you will receive movie review sentences. Your job is to"

3. Combine the different parts with Prompt 3, selectively replace it with the different parts in step 2 and generate a new prompt:
Prompt 3: Assess a movie or a book based on its explanation and determine the sentiment of the movie review. Have your colleague's evaluation of the movie they watched be expressed in a concise remark (e.g. awesome, all right, terrible, or horrendous) following the narrative synopsis they were provided, and choose from terrible, bad, okay, good and great to describe the movie.
New Prompt: In this assignment, you will receive movie review sentences. Your job is to evaluate the review and determine the sentiment, choosing from terrible, bad, okay, good, and great to describe the movie.

4. Crossover the prompt in step 3 with the following basic prompt and generate a final prompt bracketed with <prompt> and </prompt>:
Basic Prompt: You are a sentiment classifier. To do this, you must first understand the meaning of the sentence and any relevant context. And then you should classify it as one of the following categories: terrible, bad, okay, good, great.

- "transforming the input into simpler terms" vs "ensuring that the sentences are easier to understand"
- "while maintaining its core idea" vs "while preserving the original intent"

### Step 2: Randomly mutate the different parts

- "Edit the text" -> "Adjust the content"
- "Revise the provided material" -> "Refine the given text"
- "by rephrasing complex phrases" -> "through simplifying intricate phrases"
- "to clarify its message through simplified expressions" -> "to enhance its clarity with straightforward language"
- "removing unnecessary wording" -> "omitting redundant expressions"
- "removing superfluous terms" -> "eliminating excessive words"
- "transforming the input into simpler terms" -> "converting the text into more accessible language"
- "ensuring that the sentences are easier to understand" -> "making the content more comprehensible"
- "while maintaining its core idea" -> "while keeping the original message intact"
- "while preserving the original intent" -> "while upholding the primary intention"

### Step 3: Combine the different parts with Prompt 3 and generate a new prompt

**Prompt 3**: Enhance the provided material by understanding its details and transforming complex phrases into straightforward language, while ensuring the original message is preserved and unnecessary words are eliminated.

**New Prompt**: Adjust the content by simplifying intricate phrases and omitting redundant expressions, converting the text into more accessible language while keeping the original message intact.

### Step 4: Crossover the prompt in Step 3 with the Basic Prompt and generate a final prompt

**Basic Prompt**: Paraphrase the text by simplifying its meaning while maintaining its significance by converting elaborate sentences into straightforward language and removing redundant terms.

**Final Prompt**: <prompt>Refine the given text by enhancing its clarity with straightforward language, while simplifying intricate phrases and eliminating excessive words to uphold the primary intention.</prompt>

**Prompt 1:** Rewrite the offered content to simplify its meaning by transforming complex sentences into plain language and eliminating any unnecessary words while preserving the original intent.

**Prompt 2:** Transform the provided content by condensing its meaning and streamlining complicated expressions into simpler language while ensuring that unnecessary jargon is eliminated and the original intent is preserved.

**Different parts:**
- "Rewrite the offered content" vs "Transform the provided content"
- "to simplify its meaning by transforming complex sentences" vs "by condensing its meaning and streamlining complicated expressions"
- "eliminating any unnecessary words" vs "ensuring that unnecessary jargon is eliminated"
- "while preserving the original intent" (both prompts use this phrase)

### Step 2: Randomly mutate the different parts

- "Rewrite the offered content" -> "Rephrase the given material"
- "Transform the provided content" -> "Modify the supplied text"
- "to simplify its meaning by transforming complex sentences" -> "to clarify its meaning by simplifying intricate sentences"
- "by condensing its meaning and streamlining complicated expressions" -> "by simplifying its essence and clarifying complex phrases"
- "eliminating any unnecessary words" -> "removing superfluous terms"
- "ensuring that unnecessary jargon is eliminated" -> "making sure that complex jargon is removed"

### Step 3: Combine the different parts with Prompt 3

**Prompt 3:** Enhance the provided material by understanding its details and transforming complex phrases into straightforward language, while ensuring the original message is preserved and unnecessary words are eliminated.

**New Prompt:** Modify the supplied text by clarifying its meaning through simplifying intricate sentences, ensuring the original message is preserved and removing superfluous terms.

### Step 4: Crossover the prompt in step 3 with the following basic prompt

**Basic Prompt:** Paraphrase the text by simplifying its meaning while maintaining its significance by converting elaborate sentences into straightforward language and removing redundant terms.

**Final Prompt:** <prompt>Rephrase the given material by simplifying its essence and clarifying complex phrases while maintaining the original message and ensuring that redundant terms are removed.</prompt>
